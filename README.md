# JPACRUDProject

### Description
In this project we were tasked with creating a DataBase of any subject of our choice. The requirements were to Create an application that utilizes MySQL to manipulate data and allow the user to preform basic CRUD operations.

I decided to make an online Art gallery combining my two loves - art and coding!

### HOW TO USE

On the home screen the name of my project is displayed and you have four options to choose from in the navbar at the top (which is displayed on every page). First, if you click on the "CCL" (my initials) it brings you to the home screen. Second, you have the option "show all" which brings you to a page that lists all of the art pieces in the Data Base. Next, the "Upload" option brings you to a page where you are prompted to fill in information on the piece you would like to upload. Lastly, The "Search ID" button will search for a art piece by an id number and show its information page.

When you navigate to an art piece an overview of all of the art piece info is shown and there are two options to choose from - Delete and Update. Update will take you to a page similar to the Upload page where all of the slots will be prefilled with the information and you can edit it. Once the form is submitted it will take you back to the overview page and the changed information will be shown. Finally, the Delete button will delete the page and show a message confirming the deletion of the piece.

### Lessons learned
<li>  I learned how to create a database and add different tables using MySQLWorkbench.
<li> Also, when labeling the items on the DataBase table, they need to match exactly on the Entity files.
<li> When you make the Dao Implementor automatically Transactional you don't have to include the start and commit transaction, it does it all by its self.
